# Talk-To-Paper-an-LLM-Based-Model
This project focuses on building a unique Large Language Model (LLM) specially designed for academic institutions. The goal is to cre- ate a general-purpose model that can understand and respond to a wide range of questions using private data from the academy.. By training the model on this specific data, it will be able to provide accurate answers related to students, administration, and research activities. Although
building a custom LLM requires more time, effort, and resources, it is highly valuable as it gives better control over the data and responses. The model will support students academically, improve administrative
tasks, and help promote research and innovation within the institution. We use GPT-2 pretrained weights as a base and apply fine-tuning on general and domain-specific private datasets. A user-friendly interface
is created using Streamlit, which allows users to input questions and receive answers directly from the model.

Our Objectives
1. Develop a Custom Academic LLM for Complete Institutional Support The development involves the following key steps:
• Build a Language Model from Scratch: Begin by constructing the core ar-
chitecture of the LLM tailored to institutional needs, enabling advanced language
understanding and generation capabilities.
• Initialize with Pretrained GPT-2 Weights: Leverage GPT-2’s pretrained
weights to establish a strong foundational understanding of general language
while minimizing training time and resource use.
• Perform General Fine-Tuning: Train the model on a wide range of pub-
lic datasets to enhance its general-purpose language proficiency and contextual
understanding.
• Apply Domain-Specific Fine-Tuning on Private Academic Data: Fur-
ther fine-tune the model using internal academic data, allowing it to learn spe-
cialized vocabulary, institutional processes, and context-specific knowledge for more accurate, relevant responses.

2. Ensure Full Control, Privacy, and Relevance of Information By training the
model on internal data and avoiding reliance on external APIs, we maintain strict
control over both input and output. This enhances data security and allows the
model to generate highly relevant and trustworthy answers tailored to the institution’s
context.
3. Promote Innovation through an Interactive, Intelligent Interface Integrate
the model with a simple Streamlit-based interface to make it accessible for everyday
use. From academic queries to administrative help, the model will act as a smart
assistant—encouraging innovation, smoother operations, and enhanced learning ex-
periences.
