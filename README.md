# Talk-To-Paper-an-LLM-Based-Model
This project focuses on building a unique Large Language Model (LLM) specially designed for academic institutions. The goal is to cre- ate a general-purpose model that can understand and respond to a wide range of questions using private data from the academy.. By training the model on this specific data, it will be able to provide accurate answers related to students, administration, and research activities. Although
building a custom LLM requires more time, effort, and resources, it is highly valuable as it gives better control over the data and responses. The model will support students academically, improve administrative
tasks, and help promote research and innovation within the institution. We use GPT-2 pretrained weights as a base and apply fine-tuning on general and domain-specific private datasets. A user-friendly interface
is created using Streamlit, which allows users to input questions and receive answers directly from the model.
